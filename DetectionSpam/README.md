---------------------------------***SPAM SMS DETECTION***------------------------------------------

Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages

Spam Detection with Naive Bayes and TF-IDF
This project uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classification model to detect 
"spam" or "ham" (non-spam) messages in a dataset of text messages. The process 
includes text data preprocessing with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), 
splitting the data into training and test sets, training the model, and evaluating and 
visualizing the results.
