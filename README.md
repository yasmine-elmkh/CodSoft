Completed Tasks for Machine Learning Internship
As part of the CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship, I have successfully completed the following tasks:

1.Movie Genre Classification: I developed a machine learning model to predict movie genres based on plot summaries.
Techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings were used along with classifiers such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

2.Spam SMS Detection: I created a model to identify spam messages from legitimate ones using text classification techniques.
I employed methods such as TF-IDF and Naive Bayes for this task.

3.Handwritten Text Generation: I implemented a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. 
The model was trained on a dataset of handwritten text samples, enabling it to generate new text based on learned patterns.

-->Each project was aimed at building key machine learning skills and applying them to real-world problems. You can find the code 
and documentation for all these tasks in this repository.
