-------------------------------***MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION***--------------------------------------

Creating a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

In this project, we aim to compare the performance of two fundamental classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. After preprocessing and splitting the dataset, both models 
are trained and evaluated using key classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

To visualize the comparison, we generate a bar chart showing the scores of each model across these metrics.
This visual representation allows for a clear and direct interpretation of which algorithm performs better 
on the given dataset.

The final graph is saved as an image file (comparaison_modeles.png) to support further analysis or
inclusion in reports and presentations.
